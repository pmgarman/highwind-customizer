== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why is this not a part of the theme? =

Themes should be lean, and Highwind is a lean mean fast WordPress theme. To keep it lean, it has to be mean, which makes it fast. See where this is going? Not everyone needs this functoinality, so it is not a part of the core theme. Make decisions not options. 

= Why did you build this instead of Jay? =

Jay built the Highwind theme. His stance (and rightly so) is that customizations should be done via hooks and/or a child theme. This is the right way to do it, and I agree with him. My needs are slightly different and require customization across multiple sites within a WordPress network which means child themes become more of a pain and a simple GUI for each site becomes easier.
